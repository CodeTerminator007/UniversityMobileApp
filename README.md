# University Mobile App

Everything is becoming online these days; as students, we all receive assignment alerts, 
quiz alerts, and fee vouchers via WhatsApp or another online platform. However, this is 
not an ideal procedure; we would like to create an application dedicated to meeting all of 
the demands of both students and teachers. 
MyUniversity is a new open-source effort that aims to deliver campus apps,
information, and data to mobile devices.The project offers both a native app for Android 
smartphones and browser-based content for computers.
